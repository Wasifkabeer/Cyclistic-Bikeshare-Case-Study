# Cyclistic-Bikeshare-Case-Study

## Introduction 
I will be analyzing a fictional compnay called Cyclistic, a bike sharing company from Chicago, in order to answer some business questions. In particular, the company has requested me to determine the key differences between casual bike riders versus member riders in order to increase the purchase of memberships among said casual riders. The director of marketing believes that by maximizing the number of annual memberships will lead to higher profit margins for the company. In order to complete this task, I will be analyzing Cyclistic trip data from the year 2023 in the following steps; Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act. 

### More About Cyclistic 

Cyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600
docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand
tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities
and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for
traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more
likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.

## Ask 

There is only one key question we need to ask ourselves during this phase of the analysis; How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclisitc bikes differently? 

## Prepare 

### Data Source 

I was able to obtain trip data from the year 2023 by downloading 12 files containing trip data from each month in 2023 in CSV format from [Divvy_tripdata](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). It should be noted as Cyclistic is a fictional company, however, for the purposes of this case study, these datasets were deemed appropriate and was made available by Motivate International Inc. It should also be noted that these datasets contain public data that can be used to explore how different customer types are using the Cyclsitic service. Due to data privacy, we are unable to use any personal information about any rider. This would mean we cannot connect pass purchases to credit card numbers in order to determine if casual riders live within the local area or if they purchased multiple single passes.
