# Cyclistic-Bikeshare-Case-Study

### Introduction 
I will be analyzing a fictional compnay called Cyclistic, a bike sharing company from Chicago, in order to answer some business questions. In particular, the company has requested me to determine the key differences between casual bike riders versus member riders in order to increase the purchase of memberships among said casual riders. The director of marketing believes that by maximizing the number of annual memberships will lead to more success for the company. 

# More About Cyclistic 

Cyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600
docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand
tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities
and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for
traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more
likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day
